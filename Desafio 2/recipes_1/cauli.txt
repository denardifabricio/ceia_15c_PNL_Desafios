CAULIFLOWER-LEEK PUREE


This recipe originally accompanied Sugar Snap Peas and Baby Carrots with 
Cauliflower-Leek Puree.

6 cups 1-inch pieces cauliflower
1 cup chopped leeks (white and pale green parts only)
1 cup canned chicken broth

Place cauliflower in large microwave-safe bowl. Add leeks and 1 cup broth. 
Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Microwave on high until vegetables are very 
soft, about 14 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to 
processor. Blend until smooth. Mix in cooking broth by tablespoonfuls to 
thin, if desired. Season with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. 
Cover; chill. Rewarm, covered, in microwave before serving.)

Serves 8.
