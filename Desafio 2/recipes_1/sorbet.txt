Basil and Lime Sorbet

1 wineglass water (about 5 ounces)
1 wineglass sugar (equal in weight to the water)
5 to 6 limes, zested
1 glass lime juice
1 very large bunch basil, pounded to a puree

Place the water and sugar in a pan, bring to a boil, and simmer for 4 
minutes with the lime zest. Remove from the heat, and allow to cool for a 
while. Add the lime juice and basil puree. Stir this up and leave to 
infuse for a while. Pass it through a coarse sieve and pour into a plastic 
tub or earthenware dish and place in the freezer. Generally, sorbet takes 
2 hours to set. Try to stir it around every 30 minutes, if you remember. 
Serve it in a glass on its own.
