BLANCHING NUTS: In the case of nuts, especially with almonds, pistachios 
and hazelnuts, in addition to the tough outer husk, they have a thin inner 
lining which needs to be removed. This lining can be bitter and somewhat 
unattractive when found in confection and baked goods. Blanching can be a 
time consuming process. Think about  purchasing them already blanched and 
skinned. Nuts can then be chopped and then toasted, if desired.

ALMONDS:	
Shell almonds and place them in a saucepan. Cover them with water.  

Boil for 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain and rinse nuts in cold water.  

Pinch off the almond skins by holding them at one end with your 
index finger and thumb, and then while pointing them into a bowl, press 
your fingers together -- be careful because they can shoot across the room!  
	
Place blanched nuts on a jelly roll or rimmed pan and dry them out 
in a 300 degree preheated oven for about 5 - 10 minutes. Don't let them 
brown.
