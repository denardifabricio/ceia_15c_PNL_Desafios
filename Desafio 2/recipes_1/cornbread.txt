Southern Wheat-free Cornbread < claymonkey > 10/27 09:48:23

from Moosewood Restaurant Daily Specials

Southern Wheat-free Cornbread

2 cups yellow or white cornmeal
1/2 cup boiling water
1 Tbs. sugar
1 tsp. salt
2 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. baking soda
1 large egg
2 Tbs. canola or other vegetable oil
1 1/4 cups buttermilk

Prehead the oven to 375F. Oil a baking pan and set aside.

In a medium bowl, stir together 1/2 cup of the cornmeal and the boiling 
water. The cornmeal will become mushy and then stiff. Set aside.

In a large bowl, sift together the remaining 1 1/2 cups of cornmeal, the 
sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.

Beat the egg into the cornmeal mush and stir in the oil. Whisk in the 
buttermilk to make a thin batter. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry 
ingredients, whisk just until the batter is smooth (don't overmix), and 
immediately pour it into the prepared pan.

Bake until the center of the cornbread is slightly rounded and firm and 
the edges are golden brown. Coll for 20 minutes or more before serving.

Notes: Bake in a square or round baking pan or in a cast iron skillet: for 
an 8-inch square or 9-inch round pan, bake for 35-40 minutes; for a 9-inch 
square or 10-inch round pan, bake for 25-30 minutes.

Vegan corn bread recipe < Penny_from_heaven > 03/03 10:53:27

This recipe won a blue ribbon at the Iowa State Fair for Dana Sly, an 
11-year old from Sioux City, Iowa.

Serves 9

2 tablespoons ground flax seed
6 tablespoons water
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup cornmeal
1/4 cup sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon table salt
1 cup soy milk
1/4 cup canola oil

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 425 degrees. Spray 
8-inch-square baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.

2. Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the ground flax 
seed, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer the ground flax seed in 
the water for 3 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Set 
aside.

3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking 
powder, and salt until well-combined.

4. Add the ground flax seed mixture, soy milk, and canola oil to the flour 
mixture. Beat just until smooth (do not overbeat.)

5. Turn into prepared baking pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a 
toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.

6. Cool on wire rack 10 minutes; invert cornbread onto wire rack, then 
turn right side up and continue to cool until warm, about 10 minutes 
longer. Cut into pieces and serve.

Skillet cornbread < Scatterbrained > 11/23 10:31:36

This is my grandparents' recipe for skillet cornbread. Note: it is 
entirely savory. It makes a perfect stuffing cornbread and is great to 
serve with a big pot of pinto beans or chili. If you like sweetened 
cornbread, this is not it.

1 cup white cornmeal
1/2 cup flour
1 TBS baking powder
1 tsp salt

Mix the dry ingredients together

about 3 TBS oil
1 beaten egg
enough buttermilk to make a thin batter (about like pancake batter)

Add to dry ingredients and stir to mix thoroughly

Bake 20-25 minutes at 455 degrees. My GPs baked it in a cast iron skillet 
that was hot from the oven, with a blob of melted bacon grease or oil in 
it, so that a crisp crust would form.

My stomach is growling as I sit here typing.

my cornbread < Miss_Informed > 10/05 14:01:48

is really easy.
i have started to add honey to the mixture and The Boy digs it.
(i can't really have it, but the boy thinks he's been a special good boy 
when he sees this going in the oven.)

i have cut the milk in half & replaced it with the honey.

Cornbread of Milk & Honey
1 c. flour
1 c. cornmeal
1 c. milk
1/4 c. butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 c. sugar
1 egg
Mix dry ingredients
cut in the cold butter with a pastry blender
in another bowl, whip milk and egg
pour into dry mix.
Mix enough to barely wet the dry ingredients. If it is mixed too well the 
final cornbread will be somewhat spongy
pour into a greased cast iron pan (equivalent to 9 inch square baking pan)
Bake for 20 min @ 425.
Cornbread will be a little crunchy on the outside and moist in the middle 
if done correctly.
We usually cut it like a pie and hope that all of it makes it to the table 
for dinner.

ps...i'm itching to know the rommie's boy band.
are you roommates with Nick Lachey???
awesome.
