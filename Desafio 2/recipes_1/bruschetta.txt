Chow's Tomato Toasts
- Michael Bauer
Wednesday, July 19, 2000

Bruschetta is all the rage these days and just about every combination of ingredients are finding their way onto toasted bread -- cauliflower and anchovy, peas and artichokes, cheese and salad greens.

The most popular, however, is the simple mixture of tomato, basil and garlic. This combination is one of the draws at Chow, an inexpensive Italian restaurant in the Castro.

It's easy for the home cook to make, too. Roma tomatoes are marinated and allowed to soak up the flavors for several hours, so even winter tomatoes taste great.

Chef/owner Tony Gulisano has worked in many fancy restaurants including Spago and Chinois on Main in Southern California, and Monsoon and Il Fornaio in the Bay Area, but his heart is in the simple food he cooks now at Chow, which opened in 1997. The restaurant looks like it's been around for decades with wainscoting, wood floors and Depression-era pendant lights hanging from the ceiling. He also opened a second restaurant, Park Chow, just down the street from Golden Gate Park on Ninth Avenue, featuring a similar style -- and price -- of food.

Chow, 215 Church St. (near Market Street), San Francisco; (415) 552-2469. Lunch and dinner daily.
SECRETS OF SUCCESS
-- Crushing the tomatoes by hand. The force and suction used to squeeze the tomatoes breaks the flesh and infuses the interior with the marinating juices. -- Using your fingers. Rubbing oil on the bread with your fingers insures a thin even coating that can't be achieved by using a brush.
MARINATED TOMATOES WITH GARLIC TOASTS
INGREDIENTS:

--8 ripe Roma tomatoes, peeled

--1 cup (or more) extra virgin olive oil

--2 garlic cloves, minced

--8 fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces

--1 teaspoon sea salt

-- 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper

--12 half-inch thick slices of chewy bread

--4 whole garlic cloves

INSTRUCTIONS: Cut the peeled tomatoes in half lengthwise and cut each half into eighths. Transfer to a bowl. Add 1/2 cup of the olive oil, the minced garlic, basil, salt and pepper. Adjust seasonings as needed.

Gently squeeze the tomato mixture with your hands to distribute the flavor and release the juices. Cover and set aside in a cool place for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours before serving.

Prepare a grill (medium heat) or heat a stovetop grill pan over medium heat.

Dip your fingers into the remaining 1/2 cup oil and rub each slice of bread with an even film. Grill the bread evenly on both sides to a deep golden color.

Remove and quickly rub the hottest surface with a garlic clove. The garlic will rub off and leave its perfume on the toast.

Arrange the toasts on a platter. Spoon the tomato mixture onto the grilled bread. Drizzle with a little more olive oil, if desired.

Serves 6.
